# :curly_loop:	While Loop Exercise:curly_loop:	
## This repository contains a Python program demonstrating the use of the while loop function to implement a specific exercise.

## :small_orange_diamond::large_orange_diamond:	Task Description::large_orange_diamond::small_orange_diamond:
The objective of this exercise is to create a program that continuously prompts the user for input using a while loop. The program should terminate when the user enters "-1" and calculate the average of all numbers entered, excluding "-1".

## :feet: Steps :feet:

:file_folder:	 File Creation:
Create a Python file named while.py.

:hammer_and_wrench:	Program Implementation:
Develop a program that utilizes the while loop to repeatedly request user input.

:no_entry_sign:	Termination Condition:
Set the termination condition to end the input loop when the user enters "-1".

:1234:	Average Calculation:
Calculate the average of all numbers entered, excluding "-1".

Instructions:
:runner: Run the program by executing the while.py file.
Follow the prompts to enter numbers.
Terminate the input loop by entering "-1".
After termination, the program will display the average of the entered numbers.


## Additional Notes:
Ensure the program handles input validation and edge cases effectively.
For further details, refer to the comments within the while.py file.
